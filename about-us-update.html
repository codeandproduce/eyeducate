I love to dance, draw, and listen to music. I also like to work with children. As a member of this club, I participate in many events, such as the music festival where we went on stage to spread awareness about protecting one’s eyes. I joined this club because I want to spread awareness for eye protection. I believe that our society is becoming more dependent on technology and the time spent on electronic devices have been increasing, which may do some damage to children’s eyes. The best way I can contribute to solving this problem is by joining this club and teaching children how to protect their eyes." data-placement="right">Name</a>
